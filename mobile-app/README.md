# Rescue Team8s
Rescue Team8s provides a mobile application for field agents of the International Rescue Committee to receive important information from administrative agents.

It consists of:
- A cross-platform mobile application for receiving crucial safety information
- A web application for administrative access with an API for field agents

The mobile application was created in React Native.

There's a basic Twilio app we created to handle text messaging but it isn't fully implemented into the core appplication yet.

# Rescue Team8s
Rescue Team8s is a pair of applications that provide a means of communication between mission members in the International Rescue Committee.

It consists of:
- A cross-platform mobile application for receiving crucial safety information
- A web application for administrative access with an API for field agents

The mobile application was created in React Native.
The web application was created in Node.js with the Express.js web framework. The database used is PostgreSQL with Sequelize.js as the Object Relational Mapper.

There's a basic Twilio app we created to handle text messaging but it isn't fully implemented into the core appplication yet.
